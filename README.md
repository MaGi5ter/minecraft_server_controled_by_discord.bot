Bot I ve wrote to control my local_machine that uses too much power to work 24/7

uses IFTTT and smart home socket 

It's hard to set, without few thing that I don't mentioned here

What It do ?

I have old server in my home, I use it only to run some game servers

So It starts my local machine by command on discord
and if no one is active on the server for some time it shutdowns it, and thats all, really simple but useful thing

In Server Status Folder is bot that needs to work on our localc machine
