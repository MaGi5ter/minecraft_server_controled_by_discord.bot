Bot I ve wrote to control my local_machine that uses too much power to work 24/7

It's hard to set, without few thing that I don't mentioned here

What It do ?

I have old server in my home, I use it only to run some game servers

So It starts my local machine by command on discord, and if no one is on it, shutdown it, and thats all

In Server Status Folder is bot that needs to work on our localc machine
